# 🌌 Milky's Way (Home)

A 2D rage game developed during a one-week GameJam at  
[BIB International College](https://www.bib.de/).  
The player controls a small astronaut with a jetpack, navigating through dangerous obstacles in space.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Jetpack controls: single push → continuous movement  
- Dynamic obstacles with knockback effects  
- Multiple level types connected by transition chunks  
- Rage-game difficulty: one mistake can set you far back  
- Modular level composition using Start/End anchors
